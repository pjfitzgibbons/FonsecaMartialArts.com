                      <p>&quot;My son has   participated in the after school Karate program (3rd and 4th grades) offered by   Fonseca Martial Arts. He started off as a new student and has recently earned   his yellow belt. I am very proud of what my son has been able to accomplish.   However, more importantly, he is very proud of his own accomplishments. He   has&nbsp;enhanced his&nbsp;sense of pride&nbsp;and self discipline. I truly believe&nbsp;the Karate   program helped to enhance these qualities.&nbsp;He is very excited about his   accomplishments and already has his eyes set on the orange   belt.</p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Fonseca Martial Arts   has had a very positive impact on my son as will as the rest of the children in   the program. The patience, the discipline and time the instructors spend with   the children is very positive while still providing fun. I would highly   recommend this program to any parent who would love to see their child have fun   and build upon their own personal character at the same time.&nbsp;It is wonderful to   see a child set goals for themselves and to go after them. What wonderful   preparation for their future!&quot;<br />

                          I wanted to express my appreciation for the work you and your staff have done here at Dawes School in our after-school program. Your program has provided a wonderful opportunity for students to try something new and different without even leaving our building, which I know their parents also appreciate! Your staff is always timely and pays close attention to the students, their safety, and their development both physically and emotionally.</p>
                        <p>As a result of participating in the karate program, our students have gained in self-esteem and confidence. They have concrete goals to work towards and receive acknowledgement of their accomplishments. Through your program the students practice many of the same skills we work on here during the regular School hours, specifically working towards goals, self-discipline, and listening. In your program they get all of that while benefiting from exercise!</p>
                        <p>We are happy that we have been able to maintain this program here at Dawes for the past year and look forward to continuing our relationship with Fonseca Martial Arts</p>

                        <p><strong>&quot;Our kids were so enthralled with John after his program that they lined up for autographs!</strong></p>
                        <p>It is rare to find a person these days who can relate in such a positive and enthusiastic manner as to command the respect and attention of kids ages 3 - Grade 6. John did just that at his presentations with our clubs. The kids were excited about the subject, eager to learn, and responded well.</p>
                        <p>The club adult leaders even got into the action! A great time was had by all. This is one event the kids and the leaders agreed must be repeated!</p>
                        <p>Thank you, John for turning a &quot;Friends Night&quot; into a memorable occasion for everyone. I would recommend you and your teaching on &quot;What To Do About Bullies&quot; to anyone working with children.&quot;</p>

                          I am writing to thank you again for Chris&rsquo;s birthday party. Christopher&rsquo;s party at the Dojo was a tremendous success.  Chris, and Elliot couldn&rsquo;t have been more helpful.  Christopher&rsquo;s friends thoroughly enjoyed the karate games the Sensei&rsquo;s created.  Christopher was in seventh heaven being the center of attention, and sharing with his friends his knowledge of karate. <br />
                          <br />
                          Christopher&rsquo;s study of karate at Fonseca Martial Arts has been a tremendous experience for him, resulting in his increased confidence, coordination, respect and sense of responsibility.  He thoroughly enjoys his karate sessions, and always looks forward to them. <br />

                        <p><strong>Dear John, </strong><br />
                            <br />
                          In my quest to find a martial arts school that was right for me, I visited most of the other dojos in Skokie and found many of the classes had only one or two people.  I visited yours several times and found it fit my needs perfectly.  My search was for a larger class size, where the emphasis would not be on me to compete. <br />
                          <br />
                          I was extremely pleased with what I saw; and how you, the instructor, made everyone feel a part of each class.  For me, at 64, and one of your older students, being able to participate at a comfortable level was important and I can do that. <br />
                          <br />
                          That being said, I would not hesitate to recommend Fonseca Martial Arts to anyone wanting to get involved with martial arts.<br />

                        <p><strong>Dear Sensei John and Sensei  Elisa,</strong></p>
                        <p>On behalf of Alexander and  our whole family I just wanted to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for the huge impact Fonseca  Martial Arts, its instructors, students and parents have had on our lives.&nbsp; When I signed Alexander up for Little  Dragons 4½ years ago I was thrilled to have found a karate  program that had classes at 4:30 in the afternoon—instead of the 7:00 p.m.  classes for 4 and 5 yr. olds that the other local dojos seemed to have on their  schedule.&nbsp; I signed him up because  I was also looking for a sport that focused on discipline and respect while  allowing my son to work off his seemingly endless supply of energy.&nbsp; Little did I know that Fonseca Martial  Arts would give us so much more—and not just for Alexander but for our entire  family as well.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Learning the art of karate  from national, international and world champions like yourselves and the other  FMA instructors has indeed been a privilege.&nbsp; While he was always pretty shy around you both, Alexander  was very proud of the fact that he was learning karate from a world champion  and a hall-of-famer.&nbsp; Not only do  you teach your students kata, kumite, and kobudo but you also teach them life  skills such as respect, teamwork, camaraderie, confidence, perseverance, good  sportsmanship, discipline, and how hard work pays off.&nbsp; &nbsp;While Alexander now has a great foundation in karate thanks  to FMA, he also has learned how to be a better person, a determined competitor,  and how to be gracious after losing --all thanks to your instruction.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Besides the world-class  instruction that Alexander and I both received, it is perhaps the dojo family  that has had just as large as an impact on our lives.&nbsp; After spending 3-4 afternoons a week at FMA, Alexander  forged wonderful friendships with his fellow students, his younger sister  Kerrigan became friends with many younger siblings, and I developed lasting  friendships with some amazing parents.&nbsp;  Your family-oriented dojo fosters a welcome atmosphere, a true sense of  community and belonging, and a supportive environment in which to train.&nbsp; It is a very special place and we miss  it greatly.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Best of luck for continued  success and we hope that we will see you, your students and their parents at  future tournaments!</p>
                        <p>With great appreciation and  affection,</p>
                        <p><strong>Katherine Bunker</strong></p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Dear Sensei John and Sensei  Elisa,</strong></p>
                        <p> I want to thank you both for being such great coaches. You really talk to the kids in a way that is a great mix of motivation and self-development. And you do a great job dealing with the kids where they are, developmentally. Dakota has really internalized that it's less about the color of the medal and more about self-knowledge, his application of what you teach and his character in the ring. As a mom, I can't tell you how much that means to me. You guys give these kids an incredible opportunity to witness pro athletes up close. And you give them a value system that endures in the face of some fairly challenging situations for nine-year-olds. I feel that both of you have been such a positive, formative influence on Dakota and I'm so grateful for it. So, thank you.</p>
