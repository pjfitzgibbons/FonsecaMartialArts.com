                        Sensei Elisa Au Fonseca is recognized on the karate  circuit as both a world-class athlete and a talented instructor; her  accomplishments and reputation are particularly respected because she earned  them at such a youngage. Even as she pursued her rigorous training and  competition schedule as a teenager in her native state of Hawaii, she began teaching after school  karate programs, sharing her competition-winning technique with students of all  ages. Many of these children have pursued karate to become national champions.  One of her students went on to win two junior world championship titles. She  continues to advance her teaching methods in the Chicago area, here at Fonseca Martial Arts.</span> </p>

                          <span class="BodyBlack">In 1996, Fonseca became the first American to medal at World  Championships in almost twenty years. He is the only male karate athlete in the  world to win repeat gold medals at the Pan American Games, and the only  American karate athlete to win the Paris Open. His competitive accomplishments  are recognized both nationally and internationally, earning him the U.S.  Olympic Athlete of the Year award three years running and an induction into both  the USAKF&rsquo;s and Black Belt Magazine&rsquo;s Halls of Fame.</span></p>

                          <span class="BodyBlack">Sensei Fonseca has been teaching children and adults martial  arts for the last fifteen years. In 2003, he opened Elite Martial Arts &amp;  Fitness in Skokie, Illinois (now named Fonseca Martial Arts). The dojo has afforded Sensei  Fonseca and his staff the ability to instruct several hundred students in the  art of Karate and Judo, and Fonseca Martial Arts students continue to take top medals in the  local, regional and national karate competition in which they&rsquo;ve competed.  Through martial arts instruction, students develop respect for others, a sense  of personal responsibility and discipline as they develop their technique and  skills. FMA's curriculum and approach are designed to work with people of all  levels of skill and fitness, from beginning to advanced, to bring out the best  in every individual.</span></p>
                      <span class="BodyBlack">The FMA Programs have now expanded into local  schools, park districts, and corporate locations. </span>

                      <p>In 1992, after nineteen years of ceaseless training, he   founded NorthShore Aikido in Skokie, Illinois, where he taught and trained   students for thirteen years.  To this   day, he considers those years among the best of his Aikido career.  In 2000, Benjamin Sensei was awarded a   6th degree black belt through Saotome Sensei and the Aikido World   Headquarters in Japan.  </p>
                      <p>Currently, with much enthusiasm, Benjamin Sensei begins a new   chapter by founding Aikido of Evanston, which is located at Fonseca Martial Arts   at 823 ½ Chicago Ave. Evanston IL.  He is   proud to be associated with the high quality instruction provided at Fonseca   Martial Arts by Elisa and John Fonseca Senseis in Karate, and Yoshinaga Sensei   for Judo.</p>
